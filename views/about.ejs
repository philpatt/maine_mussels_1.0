                        For our youngest players we are educating them on the sport, sportsmanship, teamwork and smart gameplay. While a winning
                        outcome is desired, we are striving for player development. These players are learning and absorbing, we want them to
                        continue to love the sport and understand the nature of the game. We are constantly working on stick skills, game smarts
                        and teamwork. These players should be dedicated to their team, the game and giving it their all on the field. Competitive
                        natures often develop at this age and we work to tame the aggression with smart gameplay and sportsmanship.

                        For our high schoolers, we begin working with families to get their players in front of college coaches and help guide them
                        along the recruiting process. Each tournament is chosen to enhance their visibility with lacrosse coaches from top schools. For all of our players and families, we believe respect for the game, our teammates, our coaches and ourselves is paramount.
